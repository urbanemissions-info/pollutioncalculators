Demonstration of a method to estimate open waste burning emissions (and run some scenarios) based on waste generation rate, waste collection efficiency, and waste burnt rate.

Excel tool can be downloaded here: [Waste burning](https://www.urbanemissions.info/wp-content/uploads/misc/waste_burning_v1.xlsx?_gl=1*1rr5nky*_ga*MTU5NTY2MDYyNC4xNzE2MzQ4NTYw*_ga_64XLW7JTP7*MTcyMzcwMDc3Ny4xMS4xLjE3MjM3MDI4MDAuMC4wLjA.)
