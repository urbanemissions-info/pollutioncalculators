# pollutioncalculators

Most available tools to study air pollution are complex (state-of-the-art) and data-intensive (multi-purpose). This makes it difficult for practitioners from data-scarce low and middle income countries to support decision making in reducing air pollution. UrbanEmissions.info has been developing SIM-air family of tools (â€œSimple Interactive Models for better air quality) to fight this challenge. These tools help in building pollution scenarios for city managers thus aiding decision making. All tools can be explored here: [Tools](https://urbanemissions.info/tools/)

These tools were initially built on Microsoft Excel. They primarily are **Linear Programming** problems. The tools have always been open to use - users can download the Excel sheets. In an attempt to open-source these tools, we are now writing Python codes to solve the Linear programming problems.
